### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer originally from NYC! I have a huge interest in building open source software solutions using Javascript, ReactJS, NodeJS, & Python. In my spare time, Iâ€™m either building on my software developer skillset, watching CNBC or reading up on the latest technological R&D. I am highly interested in providing skills to a company within the fintech, investment, or technology industry. 

Check out what i'm currently up to here!
